# TripMapper Java GUI Project

TripMapper is a user-friendly, customizable GUI for plotting and animating GPS-coordinate paths on an interactive map using JMapViewer from OpenStreetMap. Users can upload a CSV file with coordinates and timestamps, select a marker image for the current position, set animation speed, and decide whether to include idle time. The animation displays a color-coded path indicating speed and allows pausing or restarting.

A .jar file, sample dataset, and marker image are included to run the program.
